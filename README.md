## About

Eye movement recording is quickly becoming ubiquitous across different interfaces.  The ability to draw inferences about processing from eye movements has long been used in academic settings.  Here, we will explore how the connection between eye movements and cognitive processing, as related to cognitive state, can be used in applications.
The cognitive state of a user can inform not only whether or not they stay on task, but what type of thinking (explorative, expert, creative) is currently engaged. With the advent of AI in this field, eye movement recordings can be used to decode, guide and encourage different cognitive states. 

This workshop will be used as a space in which researchers from across different disciplines (HCI, psychology, AI, cognitive neuroscience) can interact and strengthen this budding field.  The use of eye movements to decode cognitive states could be extended to adaptive interfaces that could use eye movements as feedback to guide attention, processing, learning and memory. 
The development of such tools could have some far reaching implications for our society and launch a whole new way of human-computer interaction.

## About the Speakers
**Andrew Duchowski** is a Professor in the School of Computing at Clemson University and his research and teaching interests include visual attention and perception, eye tracking, computer vision, and computer graphics.  

**Laura Matzen** is a Principal Member of the Technical Staff in the Cognitive Science and Systems department at Sandia National Laboratories. Her primary research interests lie in using cognitive neuroscience methods to understand how humans process and remember information while performing complex reasoning tasks.

**Oleg Komogortsev** is a tenured Associate Professor at Texas State University and a Visiting Scientist at Facebook Reality Labs. He conducts research in eye tracking with a focus on cyber security (biometrics), health assessment, human computer interaction, usability, and bioengineering.

**Enkelejda Kasneci** is a Junior Professor of Computer Science at the University of Tübingen, and her main research interests are applied machine learning, eye-tracking technology and applications, and driver assistance systems.

**Gregory Zelinsky** is a Professor of Cognitive Science at Stony Brook University. His  research attempts to integrate cognitive, computational, and neuroimaging techniques to better understand a broad range of visual cognitive behaviors, including visual search, object representation, working memory, and scene perception.

**Alexandra Papoutsaki** is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Pomona College. Her main research focuses on eye tracking and gaze sharing in the context of remote collaboration. She received her PhD from Brown University where she developed a new approach for webcam eye tracking in the browser.


## Organizers
[**Monica Castelhano**](https://qvcl.ca/) is an Associate Professor in Psychology at Queen’s University. Dr. Castelhano studies memory and attentional processes in complex visual environments in real and virtual settings using techniques such as VR, eye tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG).  Dr. Castelhano has been granted numerous awards including the Early Researcher Award from OSF and numerous grants from national and international funding agencies. She is currently an Associate Editor at the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.

[**Zoya Bylinskii**](http://web.mit.edu/zoya/www/index.html) is a Research Scientist at Adobe Inc.

## Call for Participation

In this workshop we will explore how the connection between eye movements and cognitive processing can be used for applications. We invite papers on topics related to the use of eye movements (fixations, saccades, blinks, pupil dilations) for the analysis or prediction of cognitive processing.  This could include, but is not limited to, a viewer’s cognitive load or affective state, expertise or individual traits, the task type or difficulty, as well as their relationship to user interfaces broadly construed (driving, reading, problem solving, navigating, data analysis, coding, creating content, etc.). 

We invite submissions of a maximum of 4 pages, excluding references. The length of the submission should be commensurate with the contribution. Submissions will be sent out for review to 2 experts, who will rate the quality of the submission as well as the topic fit to the workshop. Submissions should follow the [ACM SIGCHI Extended Abstracts format](http://chi2019.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/). Information about where and when to submit the abstracts will be posted on https://emics-2020.github.io/CHI/. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. 

Accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop.
