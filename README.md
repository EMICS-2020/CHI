## About

Eye movement recording is quickly becoming ubiquitous across different interfaces.  The ability to draw inferences about processing from eye movements has long been used in academic settings.  Here, we will explore how the connection between eye movements and cognitive processing, as related to cognitive state, can be used in applications.
The cognitive state of a user can inform not only whether or not they stay on task, but what type of thinking (explorative, expert, creative) is currently engaged. With the advent of AI in this field, eye movement recordings can be used to decode, guide and encourage different cognitive states. 

This workshop will be used as a space in which researchers from across different disciplines (HCI, psychology, AI, cognitive neuroscience) can interact and strengthen this budding field.  The use of eye movements to decode cognitive states could be extended to adaptive interfaces that could use eye movements as feedback to guide attention, processing, learning and memory. 
The development of such tools could have some far reaching implications for our society and launch a whole new way of human-computer interaction.

## Organizers

[**Monica Castelhano**](https://qvcl.ca/) is an Associate Professor in Psychology at Queen’s University. Dr. Castelhano studies memory and attentional processes in complex visual environments in real and virtual settings using techniques such as VR, eye tracking and electroencephalogram (EEG).  Dr. Castelhano has been granted numerous awards including the Early Researcher Award from OSF and numerous grants from national and international funding agencies. She is currently an Associate Editor at the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology.

[**Zoya Bylinskii**](http://web.mit.edu/zoya/www/index.html) is a Research Scientist at Adobe Inc. She received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in September 2018 and an Hon. B.Sc. in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Toronto in 2012. Zoya is a 2016 Adobe Research Fellow, a 2014-2016 NSERC Postgraduate Scholar, a 2013 Julie Payette Research Scholar, and a 2011 Anita Borg Scholar. Zoya works at the interface of human vision, computer vision, and human-computer interaction: building computational models of people's memory and attention, and applying the findings to graphic designs and data visualizations.

[**Xi Wang**](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/xiwang/) is a graduate student at the Technische Universität Berlin. Her research is broadly concerned with human perception and its applications in computer graphics. She has worked on projects studying vergence eye movements in 3D space, using mental imagery paradigm to study encoded visual content in (episodic) memory and measuring where humans look on real three-dimensional stimuli.  


## Call for Participation

In this workshop we will explore how the connection between eye movements and cognitive processing can be used for applications. We invite papers on topics related to the use of eye movements (fixations, saccades, blinks, pupil dilations) for the analysis or prediction of cognitive processing.  This could include, but is not limited to, a viewer’s cognitive load or affective state, expertise or individual traits, the task type or difficulty, as well as their relationship to user interfaces broadly construed (driving, reading, problem solving, navigating, data analysis, coding, creating content, etc.). 

We invite submissions of a maximum of 4 pages, excluding references. The length of the submission should be commensurate with the contribution. Submissions will be sent out for review to 2 experts, who will rate the quality of the submission as well as the topic fit to the workshop. Submissions should follow the [ACM SIGCHI Extended Abstracts format](http://chi2019.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/). Information about where and when to submit the abstracts will be posted on https://emics-2020.github.io/CHI/. At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference. 

Accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop.
