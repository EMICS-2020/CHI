Proposed CHI'20 workshop on "Eye Movements as an Interface to Cognitive State"

Eye movement recording is quickly becoming ubiquitous across different interfaces.  The ability to draw inferences about processing from eye movements has long been used in academic settings.  Here, we will explore how the connection between eye movements and cognitive processing, as related to cognitive state, can be used in applications.
The cognitive state of a user can inform not only whether or not they stay on task, but what type of thinking (explorative, expert, creative) is currently engaged. With the advent of AI in this field, eye movement recordings can be used to decode, guide and encourage different cognitive states. 

This workshop will be used as a space in which researchers from across different disciplines (HCI, psychology, AI, cognitive neuroscience) can interact and strengthen this budding field.  The use of eye movements to decode cognitive states could be extended to adaptive interfaces that could use eye movements as feedback to guide attention, processing, learning and memory. 
The development of such tools could have some far reaching implications for our society and launch a whole new way of human-computer interaction.
